# Infinite Disc

## Description
As a record store, it is important to keep up-to-date inventory at all times to ensure you have the records customers need. We understand doing this on paper could be a hassle, so we decided to make something much easier and convinient. Our website allows employees to login or create an account. After they do so, they are directed to a genre list where they can pick the genre they need to keep inventory of. All they have to do from there is input some information and the inventory will be stored for them to look back on at any time.
